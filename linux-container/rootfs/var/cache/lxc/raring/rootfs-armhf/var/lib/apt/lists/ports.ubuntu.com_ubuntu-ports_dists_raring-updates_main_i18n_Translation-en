Package: clamav
Description-md5: 25816a2f56a0c214a484e117fd9fe0b1
Description-en: anti-virus utility for Unix - command-line interface
 Clam AntiVirus is an anti-virus toolkit for Unix. The main purpose of
 this software is the integration with mail servers (attachment
 scanning). The package provides a flexible and scalable
 multi-threaded daemon in the clamav-daemon package, a command-line
 scanner in the clamav package, and a tool for automatic updating via
 the Internet in the clamav-freshclam package. The programs are based
 on libclamav6, which can be used by other software.
 .
 This package contains the command line interface. Features:
  - built-in support for various archive formats, including Zip, Tar,
    Gzip, Bzip2, OLE2, Cabinet, CHM, BinHex, SIS and others;
  - built-in support for almost all mail file formats;
  - built-in support for ELF executables and Portable Executable files
    compressed with UPX, FSG, Petite, NsPack, wwpack32, MEW, Upack and

 For scanning to work, a virus database is needed. There are two options
 for getting it:
  - clamav-freshclam: updates the database from Internet. This is
    recommended with Internet access.
  - clamav-data: for users without Internet access. The package is
    not updated once installed. The clamav-getfiles package allows
    creating custom packages from an Internet-connected computer.

 Duplicity backs directories by producing encrypted tar-format volumes
 and uploading them to a remote or local file server. Because duplicity
 uses librsync, the incremental archives are space efficient and only
 record the parts of files that have changed since the last backup.
 Because duplicity uses GnuPG to encrypt and/or sign these archives, they
 will be safe from spying and/or modification by the server.

Package: libxml2-utils-dbg
Description-md5: 54315da2c98caf530cdead72cdb9a09b
Description-en: XML utilities (debug extension)
 XML is a metalanguage to let you design your own markup language.
 A regular markup language defines a way to describe information in
 a certain class of documents (eg HTML). XML lets you define your
 own customized markup languages for many classes of document. It
 can do this because it's written in SGML, the international standard
 metalanguage for markup languages.
 .
 This package provides the debugging symbols for the utilities provided
 by the libxml2-utils package.
